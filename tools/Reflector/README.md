This is the ASK Reflector skill.  There is no interaction model as it is agnostic to the model being used so it can help you more quickly get starting developing an interaction model.

## Usage

1. Create a new AWS Lambda function (using the Fact skill application template in the Serverless Application Repository is recommended.)
1. Copy the contents of index.js into the Lambda function's index.js.  Save it.
1. If you haven't already, create a skill in the Alexa Developer Console, and use the Lambda function's ARN as the endpoint for the skill.
1. That's it!  Iterate on your interaction model and make a great skill!
