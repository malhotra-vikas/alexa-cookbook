## Setting up Your Voice User Interface

There are two parts to an Alexa skill.  The first part is the [Voice User Interface (VUI)](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/defining-the-voice-interface).  This is where we define how we will handle a user's voice input, and which code should be executed when specific commands are uttered.  The second part is the actual code logic for our skill, and we will handle that in [the next step](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-cookbook/blob/master/handling-responses/dialog-directive-delegate/step-by-step/2-lambda-function.md) of this step-by-step guide.

Since the purpose of this tool is to let you test any VUI, there are no special instructions or requirements for how you build your VUI.

*OPTIONAL:*
Build the [Plan My Trip](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-cookbook/blob/master/handling-responses/dialog-directive-delegate/README.md) VUI and use it to test.
